## With Ship, you can...

... quickly jot down thoughts, and then organize them later

... communicate with charts, images, video, sound, and interactive media

... manage documents, schedules, inventory, accounts, files, or whatever else needs managing

... run complex analyses and computations live or on demand

... automate tasks and interact with internet services

... share your work on the web and in app stores

## So it's like spreadsheets?

It's a lot like spreadsheets. Here are the ways it's different:

  - A value in Ship is more than just a label or amount, it's anything you can represent digitally - a note, picture, location, even a program.

  - Instead of a vast, flat grid of cells, you create Boxes as you need them, like mini-files

  - Spreadsheets only show you a snapshot of your data - Ship displays the values of Boxes as they respond to change over time, granting unparalleled communicative and exploratory power.

  - Spreadsheets don't talk to each other - all Boxes live in the same universe and can exchange data safely using a simple, secure communication system.

  - Boxes aren't limited to read-only output, they can have interactive elements; a Box can hold a widget or a whole app (and you can export it for production use - it's real software).

  - Ship formulas aren't narrow bars of obscure text, they're Boxes organized logically - you can program them by dragging and dropping. You can also use code if you'd prefer.

  - Ship itself is entirely customizable (and mostly created) using Ship.

  - It's still just an organizer and calculator, if that's all you need.
